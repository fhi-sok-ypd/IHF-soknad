Question 18 is not done.
This could have been done easily in SAS, using Macro variables to represent different municipalities, counties and the country.
However I don't have time for this now.

Question 19 is not done.
The observed numbers and expected numbers, with 95% are calcualted. The figures should have been done as well. Again, I don't have much time left tonight, so I decide to prioritize other questions.

Test: Creative Assignment not done.
I see functions to produce the map figure in Surveilance package, again, no time to do that.
